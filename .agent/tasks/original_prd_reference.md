## Key Deviations from Original PRD

### Changes Made

1. **Multiplayer Mode**: Added beyond original PRD scope
   - Turn-based gameplay
   - Redis session storage
   - Shareable invite links

2. **Number Range**: Expanded from original spec
   - Original: 0-99 (2 digits max)
   - Current: 0-999 (3 digits max)
   - Allows more variety and difficulty

3. **Color Blind Mode**: Enhanced implementation
   - Blue (#3B82F6) instead of green
   - Orange (#F97316) instead of yellow

4. **Theme System**: Enhanced beyond basic toggle
   - Auto-detection of system preference
   - Persistent storage of user choice

### Removed Features

None - all core features from PRD have been implemented or are planned.
